New to data?
Whether you’re new to data or learning more about how to use data, we’re here to help guide you through your data journey!
We’ll identify what datasets are, highlight types of data, how to sort or download data and provide additional resources.

## Creating an account
To create or not to create an account? That is the question. It depends on what you’re trying to accomplish.
Simply want to browse and download datasets? You may do so without an account.
To suggest a dataset, you must be signed-in.

To create an account, click on sign-in, under Menu on mobile or beneath the search bar on desktop  

## Datasets
What is a dataset?
A dataset is an organized collection of data elements.
Datasets can be presented in tabular or non-tabular formats.
- Tabular means data presented in columns or tables. Think of an excel spreadsheet and adding values to each column. Now think of adding values to the rows and those values corresponding to the values you input in each column.
- Non-tabular data refers to information presented in formats such as image files (jpg, png files), geospatial data (maps), or an extended mark-up language (XML) file.

### Tabular dataset examples:
- <a href="https://data.austintexas.gov/Health-and-Community-Services/Food-Establishment-Inspection-Scores/ecmv-9xxi/data">Food Establishment Inspection Scores</a>
- <a href="https://data.austintexas.gov/Public-Safety/2016-Racial-Profiling-Dataset-Arrests/834s-nvqn/data">Racial Profiling Dataset</a>

### Non-tabular dataset examples:
- <a href="https://data.austintexas.gov/Health-and-Community-Services/Austin-Animal-Center-Found-Pets-Map/hye6-gvq2">Austin Animal Center Found Pets Map</a>
- <a href="https://data.austintexas.gov/City-Government/Credit-Access-Businesses-Map/efz6-47ik">Credit Access Businesses Map</a>

## How datasets are created
According to the Open Data Glossary handbook, datasets are created by collecting data in different ways: from manual or automatic measurements (e.g. weather data), surveys (census data), records of decisions (budget data) or ongoing transactions (spending data), aggregation of many records (crime data), mathematical modeling (population projections), etc.

## How to Download and Export Data
Maybe you’ve filtered a dataset, and instead of saving it as a view, you’d like to take that data offline. Let’s walk you through the process of downloading a dataset.

Click the <b>Export</b> tab, next to the Visualize tab.
This will pull up the Export pane which offers a number of formats for exporting.

  - KML
  - KMZ
  - Shapefile
  - Original
  - GeoJSON

 After the download is finished, it can be opened in an appropriate software package. If the dataset you are requesting is large, it may take a while to download.


## How to Suggest a Dataset
Still can't find that particular dataset you are looking for after searching through the portal?
you can suggest the data using the 'Suggest Dataset' feature on the portal. The feature allows you to place public requests for data the portal doesn't have, which the community can vote up or down. The City of Austin's open data team will be notified when a new data suggestion has been made then view and reply with the appropriate information. Please note you will need to create an account or login to suggest a dataset.

To Suggest a Dataset you can:
